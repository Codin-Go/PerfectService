## 3.1 Stanford Lecture


<details>

  <summary>Click to details</summary>


### Lecture : What we can learn?

. Game . TapGesture . (RoundedRectangle, emoji) <br> 
. struct . (View, some, body, ZStack HStack, Bool, @State, Array, ForEach, \.self, spacer, padding, systemName, LazyVGrid, GridItem, aspectRatio, ScrollView, <br> 
. meaning . (Option + Click, 0..<6 <br> 
. word . (immutable, snippet, infer, <br> 
. whole . (readable, simple, short, <br> 
. Model . (MVVM Model-View-VieModel, <br> 


### Lecture 1: Getting started with SwiftUI

[View]:

. is: On Screen, Get Input and Return Output

. types: [simple view], [combine view], [bag view]

```swift 
struct ContentView: View {
   var body: some View {
      Text("Hello World!")
   }
}
```
<br> 

### Lecture 2: Learning more about SwiftUI

[@State] :

. like Pointer. Pointing Memory (Same). even memory changes.

[#spacer()] :

. all the remains space

<br>

### Lecture 3: MVVM

[_] :

. in function, underbar, don't have name

```swift
func multiply(_ operand: Int, by otherOperand: Int) -> Int {
    return operand*operOperand
}
multiply(5, by: 6) 
```

[init] :

. struct and class

. initializers

```swift 
struct RoundedRectangle { 
  init(cornerRadius: CGFloat) {
}
```

struct x class :

. stract : value type, coppied, Functional programming, No inheritance, Free init All vars, Mutability on explicitly state, Seen so far is a struct (except view, protocol), <br> 

. class : reference type, pointer, Object-oriented programming, Inheritance, Free init No vars, Mutable, MVVM is a class (UIKit (old style iOS) is class-based)


Generics :

. "don't care" type


MVVM.component:

. Model: Data capsulation

. View : UI(Control..), Layout(Visual..)

. ViewModel: Model Data process to show on View


MVVM.proscons:

.pros: on View no UIKit, independent test on UI, less strees on Controller

.cons: binding library or lots of code.


static func:

. global function. share the variable with other all object

### Lecture 4: Memorize Game Logic

[ObservableObject] Protocol and [@Published]

.When Model Changed, Publish(return and fresh)

```swift
class EmojiMemoryGame: ObservableObject {
    ...
    
    @Published private var model = createMemoryGame()
    
    ...
}
```


@ObservedObject

.When [viewModel] is [published], rebuild [body]

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: EmojiMemoryGame
    
    var body: some View {
        ...
    }
}
```

enum (enumeration)

.overview : dont need value

.Sytax : Type and case

.Iterating enum cases (tea, water)

.Associated Values (upc, qr. can be changed)

.Raw Values (previous choosen. not like Associated Values)

..Implicitly Assigned Raw Values (mercury=1, venus.. , north, south)

..initializing from a Raw Value

..Recursive Enumerations (indirect enum)

### 3.2.2 Summary 

Welcome to Swift
- About Swift
- Version Compatibility
- A Swift Tour

- About Swift
  - safe, fast, interactive programming lang
  - writing swift code is a playground lets you experiment with code and see the result immediately.
  - continues to evolve with new features and capabilities
  - goal for Swift are ambitious. 

- Version Compatibility
  - Swift 5.6, the default version of Swift included in Xcode 13. 
  - Swift 4 and Swift 4.2 functionality is available. (except, opaque type, try?, large integer)
 
- A Swift Tour
  - Simple Value 
  - Control Flow
  - Functions and Closures
  - Objects and Classes 
  - Enumerations and Structures
  - Protocols and Extensions
  - Error Handling
  - Generics

- A Swift Tour
  - Simple Value 
    - let, var
    - \()
    - Take up multiple lines : """, """
    - array[], dictionaries [:]

  - Control Flow
    - ..?
    - if, switch, for-in, while 

  - Functions and Closures
    - declare and call 
    - _ : no argument
    - can be nested. can be arguments. 
    - can write a clousre without a name by surrounding code with brace({}). ~= numbers.map({number in 3*number})
    - when a closure is the only argument to a function, can omit parentheses entirely. ~= numbers.sorted{$0 > $1} 
    
Details 
  - Objects and Classes 
    - use 'class' followed by the class's name to create a class. == class Shae { }
    - method and function declarations are written the same way.
    - Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance == shape.numberOfSides = 8 
    - Subclasses include their superclasses name after their class name == class Square: NamedShape {}
    - Overriding a method, without override, is detected by compiler as an error.
    - properties can have a gertter and setter == get{} set{}
    - dont need to compute and need to provide code : willSet and didSet == willSet { square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength}
    - optional value considering nil == let optionalSquare: Square? 

  - Enumerations and Structures
    - use Enum 
    - By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero. 
    - and incrementing by one each time. (you can change this explicitly)
    - short form == case .ace: return "ace" case .queen 
    - structures support many of the same behaviors as classes. it always coppied but classes are passed by reference. == struct Card {}

  - Protocols and Extensions
    - class, enum, and struct can all adopt protocol.
    - mutating struct need mutating. but class don't need. Because method on a class always modify the class.
    - extension to add protocol conformance
    - Even though the variable protocolValue has a runtime type of SimpleClass, the compiler treats it as the given type of ExampleProtocol. == let protocolValue: ExampleClass = a 

  - Error Handling
    - Error protocol == enum PrinterError: Error {}
    - throw == func send(job: Int, toPrinter printerName: String) throws -> String
    - do-try-catch == let printerResponse = try send(job: 1000, toPrinter: "Godoqa")
    - try? == let printerFailure = try? send(job: 998, toPrinter: "Never Has Toner")
    - defer ==  defer {fridgeIsOpen = false}
      - use defer to write a code that's executed after all other code in the function

  - Generics
    - write a name inside angle bracket to make a generic type or function or type == func makeArray<Item>(repeating item: Item, numberOfTimes: Int) -> [Items] {}
    - forms of method and function is as well as class, enum, struct. == enum OptionalValue<wrapped> {}
    - writing <T: Equatable> is the same as writing <T> ... where T: Equatble

### 3.2.3 Q & A

Typealias 
  - Not create new types. But provide new name to an existing type 
  ```swift
  typealias name = existing type
  ```

Shorthand Argument Names 
- $0 and $1 refer to the closureâs first and second String arguments. Because $1 is the shorthand argument with highest number
```swift
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { $0 > $1 } )
```

Heap
- Area of preserved computer main memory that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won't be known until the program is running. 

Generic 
- Generic Functions can work with Any Type.
```swift
func swapTwoValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}
```
Protocol
- A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements 


```swift
struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // structure definition goes here
}
```

## 3.3. Hacking with Swift

### 3.3.1 Swift 
- SpriteKit
- UIKit
- Core Graphics

Quiz (1-30 o. 31-100 o)
- Metric: many views can use. 
- iBeacon: notify around you. 
- JSON: save and send data. 
- Struct: default memberwise initializer. 
- Activity view controller: by Airdrop 
- View Conroller Calling: present()
- Codable: prefered written only in Swift
- Variadic: not zero but empty
- SpriteKit: 2D Game 
- SKTexture: can change of SKSpriteNode ; Generate Texture dynamically. 
- Trailing closure sytnax: only function and method, not lazy properties.
- Double: holds more than Float.
- nil coalescing: nil come together
- animate(withDuration:): This method of view measures time in second
- CGAffineTransform: create scaling
- Objective-C compatibility: use NSCoding, not Codable. 
- QoS: Quality of Service 
- Enum: can be strings, integers, and something else. 
- Core Graphics: can render to PDFs or to screens. It is device-independent.
- Adding a path: just prepare to draw. not draw yet unitl request it.
- touchBegan(): is called with set, not array.
- SKNode: The base class of all SpriteKit nodes.
- NSValue: needed because Objective-C was not able to store CGRect.
- Bitmask: called "bitwise or" can combine two numbers. I want to store the schedule for a reminder in a single value
- Weak reference: must be unwrapped before use.
- Multi Button: can call the same method when tapped. 
- Auto Layout: works perfectly alongside navigation bar.
- valueChanged: UISlider, everytime the slider is moved.
- CIContext: Core Image Context is expensive to create. so reuse.
- GCD background: It is higher priority than .utility and lower than .userInitiated. 
- UIColor is different with CGColor. CGColor is Core Graphic to represent color. UIColor is represented internally as a CGColor in a CGColorSpace. 
- UIKit: UIKit types like UIBeizerPath aren't available macOS. but SpriteKits can. 
- non-repeat: non-repeating timer by setting the repeats properties to false.
- resignFirstResponder(): this method is used when the user to stop editting a text view and text field.
- navigationItem: Each view controller has own navigationItem 
- inout: Changing inout parameters inside a function changes outside too.
- cells in grid: UICollectionView is better choice than UITableView 
- UNUserNotificationCenter: This lets us control who gets told when notification are triggered. 
- #selector: To point a method in any object, as long as that method is marked @objc.
- motionBegan: from view controller, not game center. 
- SKShapeNode: stroke color and line width
- MKAnnotation: must be a class, not a struct.
- isDynamic: A SpriteKit physics body with isDynamic set to false will no longer be affected by gravity. 
- Navigation controllers: are placed inside tab bar controllers. 
- Parsing JSON: doesn't touch UI. good choice for background work.
- name: Apple recommends you include your company and app name to make sure the string is unique.
- Leading and Trailing: Leading constraint is on the right edge of the screen, and Trailing is on the left. 
- AppDelegate: system notification. 
- Assertion: can help catch error.
- Set: All items in a set must be unique.
- .replace: this blend mode ignore transparency, which make it faster to draw.
- GCD: Grand Central Dispatch. it works with SpriteKit, UIKit, and other frameworks.
- Empty: Some strings might be empty depending on what your data was.
- UIColor: You can use value higher than 1.0 for red, green, blue in UIColor. for deep colors
- ctm: return current transformation matrix 
- UIView: doesn't have a zPosition property.
- Multipeer: come from Multipeer connectivity framework, not UIKit.

  #### $0, $1
    - closure's first and second Shorthand Argument Names 
    ```swift 
     let coffee: [String] = ["Cappucinno","Esspresso","Latte","Ristretto"]

   reverseOrder = coffee.sorted {$0 > $1}
   // RESULT: ["Ristretto", "Latte", "Espresso", "Cappuccino"] 
    ```

  #### "_" Operator
    - Underscore Operator represents an unnamed parameter/label. 

  #### JSON
    - JavaScript Object Notion (JSON) is text-based format for representing structured data. It is used for transmitting data in Web App. 

  #### Property Wrappers

          var body: View {
            Text(sharedText)
            TextField("shared", text: $sharedText)
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    - @EnvironmentObject: same as @ObservedObject
    - @ObservedObject: A property wrapper type that subscribes to an observable object 
      ```swift

Objective
  - 100 Apps for Swift. 
    - Review Yesterday. (o)
    - Basics Study. (o)
    - Making 1 App. ()

Details 
  - Objects and Classes 
    - use 'class' followed by the class's name to create a class. == class Shae { }
    - method and function declarations are written the same way.
    - Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance == shape.numberOfSides = 8 
    - Subclasses include their superclasses name after their class name == class Square: NamedShape {}
    - Overriding a method, without override, is detected by compiler as an error.
    - properties can have a gertter and setter == get{} set{}
    - dont need to compute and need to provide code : willSet and didSet == willSet { square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength}
    - optional value considering nil == let optionalSquare: Square? 

  - Enumerations and Structures
    - use Enum 
    - By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero. 
    - and incrementing by one each time. (you can change this explicitly)
    - short form == case .ace: return "ace" case .queen 
    - structures support many of the same behaviors as classes. it always coppied but classes are passed by reference. == struct Card {}

  - Protocols and Extensions
    - class, enum, and struct can all adopt protocol.
    - mutating struct need mutating. but class don't need. Because method on a class always modify the class.
    - extension to add protocol conformance
    - Even though the variable protocolValue has a runtime type of SimpleClass, the compiler treats it as the given type of ExampleProtocol. == let protocolValue: ExampleClass = a 

  - Error Handling
    - Error protocol == enum PrinterError: Error {}
    - throw == func send(job: Int, toPrinter printerName: String) throws -> String
    - do-try-catch == let printerResponse = try send(job: 1000, toPrinter: "Godoqa")
    - try? == let printerFailure = try? send(job: 998, toPrinter: "Never Has Toner")
    - defer ==  defer {fridgeIsOpen = false}
      - use defer to write a code that's executed after all other code in the function

  - Generics
    - write a name inside angle bracket to make a generic type or function or type == func makeArray<Item>(repeating item: Item, numberOfTimes: Int) -> [Items] {}
    - forms of method and function is as well as class, enum, struct. == enum OptionalValue<wrapped> {}
    - writing <T: Equatable> is the same as writing <T> ... where T: Equatble

Wrap-up
- Thank 3 : Wife Son Family, Country, Universe
- Impressive 3 : Basics Syntax, See the code, Understanding.  
- Review : object and class, enum and struct, diff btw class and struct, protocol, Generic. (v Error Handling, Extensions)
- Reflect : How to more focus
- Improve : 24h 1y1mDollar 1m1hApp
